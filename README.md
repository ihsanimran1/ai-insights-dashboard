## ü™µ Challenges & Solutions

| **Challenge**                                                                                      | **Solution**                                                                                                                       |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Paywalled Articles (e.g., Bloomberg, WSJ)**                                                      | Integrated `archive.ph` fallback to snapshot paywalled pages and extract content safely.                                            |
| **Anti-bot Protections (Cloudflare, dynamic JS rendering)**                                        | Used `puppeteer-extra-plugin-stealth` to bypass anti-bot measures and mimic real browser behavior.                                  |
| **Streamlit UI looked plain and unpolished**                                                       | Designed a custom CSS style with modern buttons and clean layout for better UX.                                                     |
| **Local AI (Ollama) not working in Streamlit Community Cloud**                                     | Shifted to a fully local architecture and documented the setup so users can run the app offline.                                    |
| **Long articles exceeding LLaMA token limits**                                                     | Added automatic truncation and summarization pipelines to preprocess large inputs for AI analysis.                                  |
| **PDF text extraction from scanned documents failed**                                              | Switched to PyMuPDF for better text parsing; flagged unsupported scanned PDFs with a user warning.                                  |
| **Sharing with non-technical users**                                                               | Built a Dockerfile to package all dependencies so the app can run with one command on any machine.                                  |
